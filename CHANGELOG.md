# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes to `tack` are documented in this file.

Format:
- Keep entries concise and focused on user impact.
- Group notes in this order: `Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed`, `Docs`, `Security`.
- Add a tagged section before pushing a release tag. The release workflow uses the matching section for GitHub Release notes.

## [Unreleased]

- None yet.

## [v0.1.3] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- Release paid smoke now uses the bearer token issued by `POST /pins` when polling pin status, so CI validates the authenticated owner flow that production enforces.

## [v0.1.2] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- Canonical CID ownership now records the actual successful pin time so `replacePin` no longer backdates ownership to the original request creation timestamp.
- Retrieval paywall resolution no longer guesses a payout wallet from ambiguous legacy pin history when `cid_owners` is missing, preventing misrouted Taiko USDC settlements after database upgrades.

## [v0.1.1] - 2026-03-13

### Changed
- Tack now normalizes public request URLs at the app boundary so AgentCard metadata and x402 payment metadata use the correct public HTTPS origin behind Railway and other trusted proxies.

### Fixed
- Release smoke validation now covers the paid pinning flow more accurately before deployment promotion.

### Docs
- Added `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` guidance for deterministic public URL metadata in Railway deployments.

## [v0.1.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- IPFS Pinning Service API support for pin creation, listing, replacement, deletion, and upload-based pinning.
- Public IPFS gateway retrieval with `ETag` and `Range` handling plus an A2A agent card at `/.well-known/agent.json`.
- x402 payment authentication on Taiko Alethia for paid pinning flows, with bearer-token owner auth for follow-up pin management.
- SQLite-backed pin metadata, in-memory rate limiting, and optional best-effort replica pinning across additional Kubo nodes.

### Fixed
- Production startup validation now fails fast when x402 is disabled or configured with placeholder payout or asset addresses.
- Docker and Railway deployment paths are hardened around persistent `data/` storage and health checks.

### Docs
- Added Railway deployment and Taiko x402 smoke runbooks covering volumes, backups, rollback, and go-live validation.
