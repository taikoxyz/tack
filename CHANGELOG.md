# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes to `tack` are documented in this file.

Format:
- Keep entries concise and focused on user impact.
- Group notes in this order: `Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed`, `Docs`, `Security`.
- Add a tagged section before pushing a release tag. The release workflow uses the matching section for GitHub Release notes.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Tack now accepts x402 payments on Base mainnet (`eip155:8453`) alongside Taiko Alethia. The same endpoints (`POST /pins`, `POST /upload`, paywalled `GET /ipfs/:cid`) serve both chains — unpaid requests receive a single `402` whose `payment-required` header advertises Taiko USDC and Base USDC at the same USD price. Clients pick whichever chain they already hold USDC on. Base settlement goes through the permissionless PayAI facilitator; no operator-side credentials required.
- The agent card at `/.well-known/agent.json` now publishes one x402 protocol entry per supported chain (`chain: 'taiko'` and `chain: 'base'`).

## [v0.2.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- Tack now accepts dual-protocol payments on `POST /pins`, `POST /upload`, and paywalled `GET /ipfs/:cid`: existing x402 clients on Taiko keep working unchanged, and MPP (Machine Payment Protocol) clients can pay on Tempo using USDC.e. Unpaid requests receive a single `402` response advertising both protocols — x402 via the `payment-required` header and MPP via a standards-compliant `WWW-Authenticate: Payment` challenge — so either client can pay without a second round-trip.
- The agent card at `/.well-known/agent.json` now publishes a `payments.protocols` array so agents can discover both protocols at once, including the Tempo chain ID, asset address, and asset symbol for the active network.
- New opt-in env vars: `MPP_SECRET_KEY` (enables MPP, 32+ byte HMAC secret), `MPP_TESTNET` (switches to Tempo Moderato), and `MPP_TEMPO_RPC_URL` (overrides the default Tempo RPC used for on-chain payer verification).

### Changed
- Wallet-auth JWTs issued after an MPP-paid request work transparently on owner endpoints (`GET /pins`, `DELETE /pins/:id`), so clients using MPP get the same ownership flow as x402.
- When MPP is not configured, the service is behavior-compatible with prior releases: the MPP middleware is never constructed, no Tempo RPC traffic is generated, and the agent card omits the MPP protocol block.

### Security
- **Ownership is derived from verified on-chain evidence, never from client-supplied credential metadata.** The MPP credential's optional `source` DID is client-controlled (spread unverified through `Credential.deserialize` and never checked by the Tempo `verify()` implementation), so trusting it would let a paying attacker forge `did:pkh:eip155:4217:<victim>` and mint owner-scoped JWTs for the victim. Tack now re-reads the settled Tempo transaction from RPC, locates the matching TIP-20 `Transfer`/`TransferWithMemo` event, and uses its `from` field as the canonical payer. Regression coverage lives in `tests/integration/app.test.ts > dual-protocol > ignores a forged credential.source`.

## [v0.1.6] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- Added Docker image publishing for both the Tack API and the companion Kubo image to Google Artifact Registry.

### Changed
- Pinning prices now scale linearly with file size and requested retention duration, and expired pins are automatically cleaned up after their paid term ends.
- Deployment artifacts are now oriented around containerized Kubernetes rollouts, including hardened non-root runtime defaults and semver-tagged image publishing.

### Fixed
- Kubo can now advertise its configured public swarm address so pinned content is reachable through public IPFS gateway discovery flows.

## [v0.1.4] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- Agent-native landing page now highlights paid pinning, the public gateway, and the `@x402/fetch` client flow for wallet-based integrations.
- The agent card now includes x402 spec links, the recommended client SDK, the payment header name, and wallet auth token usage details.

### Changed
- Paid pinning and upload endpoints now return structured x402 guidance in 402 responses so agents can discover the protocol, SDK, and next-step hints without reverse-engineering headers.
- 402 responses now consistently include request IDs, making production debugging easier across logs and client reports.

### Fixed
- Invalid but decodable payment proofs now return helpful JSON bodies instead of silent `{}` responses.

### Security
- Settlement-failure responses no longer leak wallet auth tokens, cache headers, or other protected-resource headers when payment does not complete.

## [v0.1.3] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- Release paid smoke now uses the bearer token issued by `POST /pins` when polling pin status, so CI validates the authenticated owner flow that production enforces.

## [v0.1.2] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- Canonical CID ownership now records the actual successful pin time so `replacePin` no longer backdates ownership to the original request creation timestamp.
- Retrieval paywall resolution no longer guesses a payout wallet from ambiguous legacy pin history when `cid_owners` is missing, preventing misrouted Taiko USDC settlements after database upgrades.

## [v0.1.1] - 2026-03-13

### Changed
- Tack now normalizes public request URLs at the app boundary so AgentCard metadata and x402 payment metadata use the correct public HTTPS origin behind Railway and other trusted proxies.

### Fixed
- Release smoke validation now covers the paid pinning flow more accurately before deployment promotion.

### Docs
- Added `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` guidance for deterministic public URL metadata in Railway deployments.

## [v0.1.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- IPFS Pinning Service API support for pin creation, listing, replacement, deletion, and upload-based pinning.
- Public IPFS gateway retrieval with `ETag` and `Range` handling plus an A2A agent card at `/.well-known/agent.json`.
- x402 payment authentication on Taiko Alethia for paid pinning flows, with bearer-token owner auth for follow-up pin management.
- SQLite-backed pin metadata, in-memory rate limiting, and optional best-effort replica pinning across additional Kubo nodes.

### Fixed
- Production startup validation now fails fast when x402 is disabled or configured with placeholder payout or asset addresses.
- Docker and Railway deployment paths are hardened around persistent `data/` storage and health checks.

### Docs
- Added Railway deployment and Taiko x402 smoke runbooks covering volumes, backups, rollback, and go-live validation.
