# Railway Deployment Baseline (API + Kubo + Persistent Storage)

This baseline is the first production path for Tack on Railway with Taiko Alethia x402 payments.

## Target Topology

Deploy two Railway services in one project:

1. `tack-api` (this repo, Dockerfile build)
2. `tack-ipfs` (`ipfs/kubo:latest` image)

Persistent volumes:

- `tack-api` volume mounted at `/app/data` for SQLite.
- `tack-ipfs` volume mounted at `/data/ipfs` for Kubo datastore.

## 1) Create Railway Services

### `tack-api`

- Source: this repository root.
- Build: Dockerfile (`railway.json` included in repo).
- Start command: `node dist/index.js`.
- Health check path: `/health`.
- Replicas: `1` (required while using SQLite file storage).

### `tack-ipfs`

- Source: deploy from image `ipfs/kubo:latest`.
- Internal port for RPC: `5001`.
- Optional public port for gateway: `8080` (only if you want direct gateway access).
- Mount persistent volume at `/data/ipfs`.

## 2) Required Environment Variables (`tack-api`)

Set these in Railway Variables.

| Variable | Value / Example | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PORT` | `3000` | Railway routes traffic to this port. |
| `IPFS_API_URL` | `http://tack-ipfs.railway.internal:5001` | Use your internal service hostname from Railway networking. |
| `DATABASE_PATH` | `/app/data/tack.db` | Must be on the mounted persistent volume. |
| `DELEGATE_URL` | `https://<ipfs-gateway-domain>/ipfs` | Returned in pin delegates metadata. |
| `TRUST_PROXY` | `true` | Railway terminates edge traffic before your service. |
| `WALLET_AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET` | long random secret | Required for owner `Authorization: Bearer` flows. |
| `X402_ENABLED` | `true` | Required for production startup checks. |
| `X402_FACILITATOR_URL` | `https://facilitator.x402.org` | x402 facilitator endpoint. |
| `X402_NETWORK` | `eip155:167000` | Taiko Alethia. |
| `X402_PAY_TO` | `0x...` treasury wallet | Must be a real address (no placeholders). |
| `X402_USDC_ASSET_ADDRESS` | `0x...` Taiko USDC | Must be a real token address (no placeholders). |
| `X402_USDC_ASSET_DECIMALS` | `6` | USDC decimals. |
| `X402_BASE_PRICE_USD` | `0.001` | Base operation price. |
| `X402_PRICE_PER_MB_USD` | `0.001` | Variable price by payload size. |
| `X402_MAX_PRICE_USD` | `0.01` | Price ceiling per request. |

## 3) Persistent Storage Strategy

- Keep SQLite at `/app/data/tack.db` on Railway volume.
- Run API with a single replica to avoid SQLite file locking/consistency issues.
- Keep Kubo data on a dedicated volume (`/data/ipfs`) so pins survive redeploys.
- Snapshot backup before risky changes:
  - copy `/app/data/tack.db`
  - export Kubo repo snapshot from `/data/ipfs`

## 4) Health Checks and Runtime Validation

- Railway health check uses `GET /health`.
- `200` means API is up and Kubo RPC is reachable.
- `503` means degraded state (`ipfs` dependency unreachable).

Post-deploy checks:

1. `GET /health` returns `200`.
2. `POST /pins` without payment returns `402`.
3. Paid retry with `payment-signature` returns `202`.

Use the full smoke runbook: [deployment-smoke.md](./deployment-smoke.md).

## 5) Rollback Notes

When a release causes issues:

1. Roll back `tack-api` to the previous Railway deployment.
2. Keep volumes attached; do not delete `tack.db` or Kubo volume.
3. If breakage is env-related (x402 wallet/asset/network), revert variables and redeploy.
4. If a data migration or write-path bug corrupted SQLite, restore `tack.db` from backup snapshot.
5. If Kubo regresses, roll back `tack-ipfs` service separately.

## 6) Taiko + x402 Go-Live Checklist

1. API and Kubo services both healthy in Railway.
2. API and Kubo persistent volumes attached and non-empty after a redeploy.
3. `X402_ENABLED=true` and `X402_NETWORK=eip155:167000`.
4. `X402_PAY_TO` and `X402_USDC_ASSET_ADDRESS` are real Taiko Alethia addresses.
5. `WALLET_AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET` is set to a strong random value.
6. `TRUST_PROXY=true` configured.
7. `/health` stable at `200` over repeated checks.
8. End-to-end smoke passes (`pnpm smoke:x402`) against Railway URL.
9. Manual pin/list/get/delete flow works with paid wallet identity.
10. Rollback owner and backup location documented before launch.
